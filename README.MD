### Hi there!
Here I develop online game on enterprise technologies, following 2 purposes:

    - To gain more experience in relevant technologies
    - To do something, I like)
    
### If you want to try it
You need java, gradle, node.js and yarn. Input into console following commands:

    - gradle buildResources build
    - java -jar build/libs/TheBattle-0.98.jar
    
Or just download compiled jar [here](https://yadi.sk/d/NZX6PzFP6gzhgA)
    
The game will start on http://localhost:9191 in your browser. 
Btw, you need another browser and another player if you want to try it, cause there is no AI for a while)
Also, if you want to connect from remote, before these steps change 'DEPLOYED_URL' in webpack.config.js to your actual ip address.
